strictly for the purposes of this project-encrypting a string via SHA and AES with another string,
it does not seem to make sense to use any random nonce, IV, salt, or pad, as running the same encryption
function multiple times creates different final encryptions. given that i want to be able to encrypt the 
string with the same master password at some unknown point in the future, i dont see how it could be done 
using the aforementioned standard tools.
